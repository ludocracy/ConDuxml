Doc-Duxml adds XML generation automation modules including documentation for a technical design captured in XML.
Features:
    - XML transforms using Ruby statements
    - Automate transforms with user input provided via XML (e.g. embedded in design file metadata)
    - Standard transforms include transposing Ruby object to table, description, map and list
    - Reserved elements including array, instance and link can be embedded in design to trigger transforms specific to those container types.
