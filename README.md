ConDuxml allows Ruby-based XML transforms allowing the automation of tasks like creating documentation for a technical design captured in XML.

Features:
    - XML transforms using Ruby statements
    - Automate transforms with user input provided via XML (e.g. Ruby embedded in XML)
    - Standard transforms include transposing Ruby object or XML to table, description, map and list and hooks to customize the output
    - Reserved elements including array, instance and link can be embedded in design to trigger transforms specified by subclassing them.
